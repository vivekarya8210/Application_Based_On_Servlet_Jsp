             </h1>
             <pre>
               On the first day of the New Year 2020, cricketer Hardik 
                 Pandya took everyone 
                by surprise as he announced his engagement with Serbian actor Natasa Stankovic.
                 Ever since, 
                a lot of wishes have been bestowed upon the couple on social media, but it was actress
                 Urvashi Rautela's comment which grabbed the
                 maximum eyeballs when she commented on Hardik's post.
                "Best wishes on your engagement. May your relationship always 
                 be filled with lots of love and
                 happiness. On your engagement, I wish you both a wonderful life and an everlasting love,"
                  wrote Urvashi, 
                 who was earlier reported to be dating Hardik.
