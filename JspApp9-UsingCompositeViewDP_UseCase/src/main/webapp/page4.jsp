             Ajinkya Rahane doesn't fuss over technical issues but India's Test vice-captain feels that the breeze in Wellington 
             and Christchurch needs to be factored in during the team's upcoming 
              two-Test series against New Zealand next month.India will be playing two Tests in Wellington 
               (February 21-25) and Christchurch (February 29-March 4) after five T20 Internationals and three ODIs.
           In an exclusive interview with PTI, Rahane spoke on a host of issues with regards to the upcoming tour where the current 
              team has a good chance of emulating the class of 2009
